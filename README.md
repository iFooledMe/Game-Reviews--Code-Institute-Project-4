## A game database - Game reviews meta scores

### A Code Institute student project

#### To the assessment team at Code Institute:
As you can see I have one small change to the code in the settings.py regarding the AWS S3 bucket settings (and of course this update to the README).

The explanation for this is that a few days before the submission deadline strange things started to happen:

1. The database migrations were corrupt and trying to reset the database, by removing the database and all migration files (except __init__.py) did not work.
2. Several times I rebuilt the project from a new clean django project (and created new clean apps) and migrated it all again.
3. At first it seemed to work, but at some point the corrupt migrations did come back (I have still no idea why this was happening, since it all should be completely clean from any previous migrations at that point). So I tried to repeat this process several times, everytime with the same result that the corruptions did pop up again. 
4. Somewhere in this process something happened to the AWS S3 bucket connection. The settings that previously did work just fine no longer worked, resulting in an error when trying to deploy on Heroku (Collectstatic did not work)
5. Also in this process all of my custom Allauth forms did stop to work (the custom templates sits in the correct structure within the main templates folder just as before when they did work, but the overrides do not apply)

Most of my time the last couple of days before the submission has been spent trying to solve these issues. I did call out for help (I refer to Neil regarding this) and at last in the morning the same day for submission I could have a tutor call. We then managed to solve the issues with the corrupt migrations, and the tutor (Michael Park) said it was one of the weirdest issues he’s ever seen in this context. Unfortunately there was no more time to solve the other issues regarding point 4 and 5 above. I did reach out for help, but it was friday afternoon and no more tutoring was possible (again I refer to the mail conversations I have had with Neil regarding this). 

At last yesterday evening I managed to set up the AWS bucket settings so that the deployed project could be run with the debug mode of (before that any attempt to run the app on heroku with debug set to off resulted in none of the static or media files loading).

Sorry for this a bit late addition where correct AWS settings where committed! (Other than that and this addition to the README I have not touched anything else, as you can see).

This also means that most of my time the last days before the submission was spent on trying to solve all of this, and less on the actual project itself. I think and hope I still managed to fix most of the issues according to the assessment protocol from you, but if there are some of these still remaining, please bear all of this in mind when looking at the project again. The big guys Django, AWS S3 and Allauth really did beat the ¤#&#¤ out of me this time!

## SUMMARY

This project aims to build a computer and console- games reviews database. In its essence it will hold a list of recent games being released for PC, Xbox- and Playstation-consoles. Each game will have it's score presented, calculated from average review scores from popular gaming sites around the world. It will also hold a short summary of the game content, tags to describe genre and themes etc. Release date, developer, publisher, short quotes from the game sites and links to those review sites. Also links to sites where the games can be bought.

See this as a sort of portal for gamers where they can get quick and easy information about the most recent games (In time older games can be added to the db a well), and from where they navigate further to each of the real game review sites if interested or to a site where they actually can buy the game. It is service for gamers wishing to get some overview of what is available and what is to come.

Besides the Meta score derived from professional reviews, a user can also add their own score for a game and also further add their own comments to a game in a specific game details page. The score shown in the list will be filtered either purely based on the professional scores by default (possibly also purely on the users own scores, or all together). Each game should have it's own discussion board where users can share their scores, views and experience from that particular game.

## FEATURES

### LIST OF GAMES

<img src="static/img/readme_files/games_list.jpg">

The home/index page contains a list of games. In a compact view the user can get some quick oversight information. Both "More Reviews" and "Read more" expands the view to show more information. The overall score presented is the total average score for the game based on all the collected professional reviews.

----------------------------------------------------------------
<img src="static/img/readme_files/filters.jpg">

A set of ordering and filtering options are available. For the moment order by score or release date, filter by release date and by Genre tags.

----------------------------------------------------------------
<img src="static/img/readme_files/mobile_view.jpg">

The more compact list of games look like this on mobile devices.

----------------------------------------------------------------

### GAME DETAILS

<img src="static/img/readme_files/game_details.jpg">

Each game has it's own details page (accesable from the games list clicking the "Games details" button). Here the user can get more of the same (information about the game) and see other users comments and scores for the given game. Logged in users can also add their own comment and score. The overall user score presented is the total average of scores users have given the game (users not giving a score excluded)


----------------------------------------------------------------

### USER PROFILE

<img src="static/img/readme_files/user_login.jpg">

Users signed in (authenticated with Django-Allauth) are presented with a simple menu in the top right corner. The users can from here access their personal user profile page or sign out.

<img src="static/img/readme_files/user_profile.jpg">

In the user profile page the users can see and access all of the comments and scores they submited for various games. The user profile also contains the normal account settings where the user can add/adit their personal information and also change their avatar picture as their representation in comments.

<img src="static/img/readme_files/select_avatar.jpg">

In here the user can also become a premium member (it is planned to skip the ads for future versions). A click on the upgrade button reveal a previous hidden element with the credit card form.

<img src="static/img/readme_files/pay_form.jpg">

Succesfull payment redirects the user to a thank you page...

## DEPLOYMENT

### Clone this project to your own working directory:
1. In this repository (as you’re reading this readme in it :-) on the top right click the green “Code” button
2. Copy the given url by clicking on the copy icon (or open it up with GitHub Desktop if you have it installed)
3. In your local IDE open Git Bash (or whatever terminal you use to work with Git)
4. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the clone to be created
5. In the terminal type “git clone” and the paste the url you just copied
6. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created in the working directory you’re currently in

### Set up your local IDE
You need the latest version of Python 3 installed and then you need to run command “pip install -r requirements.txt” to install all the necessary packages.
You also need to set up a Stripes payment account and a Amazon AWS S3 bucket. Create a env.py file and give it the following information:
- os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = Django secret key
- os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"] = Stripe publishable key
- os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = Stripe secret key
- os.environ["STRIPE_PLAN_ANNUALY_PROD_ID"] = Stripe product id
- os.environ["STRIPE_PLAN_ANNUALY_PRICE_ID"] = Stripe annually price id
- os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = Heroku postgreSQL databas URI
- os.environ["USE_LOCAL_DB"] = '1' [1=PostgreSQL on localhost, 2=SQLite on localhost, any other value Heroku postgreSQL
- os.environ["LOCAL_DB_PASSWORD"] = Password PostgreSQL on localhost
- os.environ["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"] = AWS User access key
- os.environ["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"] = AWS User secret key
- os.environ["USE_AWS"] = '1'
- os.environ["EMAIL_HOST_PASS"] = Password to chosen email SMTP server
- os.environ["EMAIL_HOST_USER"] = User name for chosen email SMTP server
- os.environ["USE_CONSOLE_MAIL"] = '1' [1=For development,  Any other = External SMTP
- os.environ["DEBUG_MODE"] = '0' [1=Debug mode, Any other = Debug set to false]
You are now ready to work with this project on your local machine.

### Deploy on Heroku
1. First you need to create an account on Heroku
2. Create a new app (Chose region depending on where you live)
3. In your new app create a Heroku PostgreSQL in “Resources”
4. Set the config variables (in accordance with the env.py file described above under “Settings”
5. You can either deploy the project by connecting Heroku to your GitHub repository (follow the instructions on Heroku site)
Or use the Heroku CLI (Install the Heroku CLI from here)
6. Once Heroku CLI is installed, login to Heroku by typing “heroku login” in the CLI and you will be redirected to a web browser window where you log in.
7. Then use Git to clone (app name) source code to your local machine (even if it is already cloned this must be done again). Type: “$ heroku git:clone -a (name of repository you are using)” in the CLI
8. Make this new dir (name of repository) your working directory with command "cd (name of repository)"
9. Make some small change to the code you just cloned in order to be able to push it to Git
10. Stage all files for commit to Git with the command “git add .” + enter
11. Commit to Git with “commit -m (Some commit message)“ + enter
12. Finally in the CLI type "git push heroku master"
...In a while after a lot of stuff flying past you on the screen has stopped flying past you, the project should be deployed

## UX

### Strategy / Business goal

The core business goal is to drive traffic that in turn can generate revenue streams from advertising and other affiliate programs (I.e Amazon). Users that wish to not get advertising messages can become premium members where they pay a monthly fee.

In order to get this traffic, the site of course needs to add value to the user. There are other sites existing doing some meta score presentation, but in my own opinion they always try to do too much, resulting in a bit confusing and messy experience where the overview is not that great. This site aims to be clean and simple. It is purely about gamers getting an overview of what games are available at the moment, what are they about, what genre and theme, what the professional critics think about them, what other gamers think about them etc. No more, no less. In that sense it should be clean of other clutter (except some necessary adds as part of the business model of course)
